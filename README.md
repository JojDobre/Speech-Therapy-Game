# Speech Therapy Game
This repository contains the source code for a web application developed as part of my bachelor's thesis at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Informatics, Technical University of Ko≈°ice. The application is designed to support speech therapy games, focusing primarily on speech recognition. **This is a demo, not the complete game.**

## Introduction
The goal of this project was to develop a web application to assist in speech therapy through interactive games. This application is designed for children with speech disorders and aims to provide a fun and engaging way of practicing pronunciation.

## Features

 - Speech Recognition: Utilizes Web Speech API for real-time speech recognition.
 - Interactive Game: Features a simple 2D game where children collect gems by correctly pronouncing words.
 - Immediate Feedback: Provides immediate feedback to users based on their speech accuracy.
