# Speech Therapy Game
This repository contains the source code for a web application developed as part of my bachelor's thesis at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Informatics, Technical University of Košice. The application is designed to support speech therapy games, focusing primarily on speech recognition. **This is a demo, not the complete game.**

## Introduction
The goal of this project was to develop a web application using Electron to assist in speech therapy through interactive games. This application is designed for children with speech disorders and aims to provide a fun and engaging way of practicing pronunciation.

## Features

 - Speech Recognition: Utilizes Web Speech API for real-time speech recognition.
 - Interactive Game: Features a simple 2D game where children collect gems by correctly pronouncing words.
 - Immediate Feedback: Provides immediate feedback to users based on their speech accuracy.
